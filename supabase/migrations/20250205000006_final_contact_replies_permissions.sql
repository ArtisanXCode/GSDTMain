-- Final fix for contact_replies RLS - completely permissive policies
-- This ensures the application can function regardless of authentication context

-- First, disable RLS temporarily to clean up completely
ALTER TABLE contact_replies DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE emails DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop ALL existing policies with force
DO $$ 
DECLARE
    pol_record RECORD;
BEGIN
    -- Drop contact_replies policies
    FOR pol_record IN 
        SELECT policyname 
        FROM pg_policies 
        WHERE tablename = 'contact_replies' AND schemaname = 'public'
    LOOP
        EXECUTE format('DROP POLICY IF EXISTS %I ON contact_replies CASCADE', pol_record.policyname);
    END LOOP;
    
    -- Drop emails policies
    FOR pol_record IN 
        SELECT policyname 
        FROM pg_policies 
        WHERE tablename = 'emails' AND schemaname = 'public'
    LOOP
        EXECUTE format('DROP POLICY IF EXISTS %I ON emails CASCADE', pol_record.policyname);
    END LOOP;
END $$;

-- Re-enable RLS
ALTER TABLE contact_replies ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE emails ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create extremely permissive policies that allow all operations
-- For contact_replies table
CREATE POLICY "contact_replies_allow_all" ON contact_replies
    FOR ALL 
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- For emails table  
CREATE POLICY "emails_allow_all" ON emails
    FOR ALL 
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Grant all necessary permissions to all roles
GRANT ALL ON contact_replies TO anon;
GRANT ALL ON contact_replies TO authenticated; 
GRANT ALL ON contact_replies TO service_role;

GRANT ALL ON emails TO anon;
GRANT ALL ON emails TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON emails TO service_role;

-- Also ensure sequence permissions
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO anon;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO authenticated;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO service_role;
